# Project FTP Deploy

Use this pattern when the user asks `gi ftp`, `gi ftp push`, `gi ftp config`,
`gi ftp folder`, `gi ftp service`, `gi upload ftp`, `gi deploy ftp`,
`gi zaley na ftp`, `gi залей на фтп`, `ги фтп`, `ги фтп пуш`,
`ги фтп конфиг`, `ги фтп папка`, or `ги фтп сервис`.

## Intent

- Treat `gi ftp`, `ги фтп`, `gi ftp push`, and `ги фтп пуш` as requests to
  upload the current project's configured build output to FTP, FTPS, or SFTP.
- Treat `gi ftp config`, `gi ftp конфиг`, and `ги фтп конфиг` as requests to
  create, inspect, or update the current project's FTP/SFTP config without
  uploading.
- Treat `gi ftp folder`, `gi ftp папка`, and `ги фтп папка` as requests to
  inspect, choose, or update the remote upload folder (`remotePath`) without
  uploading.
- Treat `gi ftp service`, `gi ftp сервис`, and `ги фтп сервис` as requests to
  manually register, inspect, or select an FTP/FTPS/SFTP service record in
  config-service without uploading.
- Keep FTP/SFTP settings in a separate project-local config file, not in chat,
  shared instructions, README prose, or global agent memory.
- Prefer `tools/deploy/ftp.local.json` for the project-local config.
- Keep `tools/deploy/ftp.local.json` untracked when it contains hostnames,
  usernames, passwords, tokens, private keys, or private remote paths.
- Commit only a redacted example such as `tools/deploy/ftp.local.example.json`
  when the project wants a documented shape.

## Config Shape

Use this JSON shape unless project-local instructions define a stricter one:

```json
{
  "protocol": "sftp",
  "host": "example.com",
  "port": 22,
  "username": "deploy",
  "passwordEnv": "PROJECT_FTP_PASSWORD",
  "privateKeyPath": null,
  "serviceId": null,
  "localPath": "dist/",
  "remotePath": "/www/example/",
  "cleanRemote": false
}
```

- `protocol` must be one of `ftp`, `ftps`, or `sftp`.
- `host`, `username`, `localPath`, and `remotePath` are required unless a
  selected `serviceId` and verified service contract supply the shared host and
  credential reference.
- `serviceId` is optional and should name the selected config-service FTP
  record when a shared FTP service is registered.
- Use `passwordEnv` or `privateKeyPath` instead of storing a password when
  practical.
- If a user explicitly provides credentials in chat, write them only to the
  project-local untracked config after confirming the destination file; do not
  echo secrets back in later messages.
- Never store FTP credentials in this shared instruction library.

## Workflow

- For `gi ftp service` / `ги фтп сервис`, read the configured
  `configServiceUrl`, query config-service for services whose contract declares
  FTP, FTPS, or SFTP capability, and either register the user-provided service
  metadata or write the selected `serviceId` into the project-local FTP config.
  Do not upload during this command.
- If a project needs FTP and `tools/deploy/ftp.local.json` has no `serviceId`,
  check config-service before asking the user for host details.
- If one matching FTP-capable service exists, use it after reading and verifying
  its contract.
- If several matching services exist, ask the user to choose with the plain
  inline numbered checkbox marker style used by `gi language`, for example
  `[ ] 1. Display name (service-id)`. Accept numeric replies against that latest
  checklist.
- If no matching service exists, offer `gi ftp service` as the command to
  register one manually, then continue with project-local config only if the
  user provides details for this project.
- Store only non-secret discovery metadata in config-service: service id,
  display name, protocol, base URL or host/port when policy allows it,
  endpoint paths, capability tags, and secret reference names such as
  `passwordEnv`. Never store raw passwords, tokens, private keys, or private
  remote paths in config-service.
- For `gi ftp config` / `ги фтп конфиг`, create or update
  `tools/deploy/ftp.local.json` from the template shape, ask only for missing
  required values, and remind the user when secrets are referenced through
  environment variables instead of stored in the file.
- For `gi ftp folder` / `ги фтп папка`, inspect or update only `remotePath`.
  If the user provides a path, validate that it is a remote deploy folder and
  save it to the project-local FTP config. If the user asks to choose a folder,
  list remote directories through the configured FTP service or project-local
  credentials when available, present a short plain inline numbered checkbox
  marker list, and accept numeric replies against that latest checklist. Do not upload files
  during this command.
- When writing config values, preserve existing fields unless the user asks to
  change them.
- When showing config status, redact `host`, `username`, `password`,
  `passwordEnv` values that reveal private names, `privateKeyPath`, and private
  remote paths unless the user explicitly asks to inspect the local file.
- Read project-local instructions, runbook, package/build manifests, and
  `tools/deploy/ftp.local.json` before asking for upload details.
- If the config is missing, look for a redacted example in
  `tools/deploy/ftp.local.example.json`, then ask the user for the missing
  non-secret details and where they want secrets stored.
- If `localPath` is missing or stale, run the documented production build before
  upload. If no build contract exists, ask one short clarification question.
- Prefer existing project deploy scripts when they read the same config and do
  not expose secrets in command output.
- If no deploy script exists, use an available standard tool appropriate to the
  protocol, such as WinSCP, `sftp`, `scp`, `lftp`, or `curl`, without printing
  secrets.
- Treat an upload stall, hang, repeated timeout, or failed stream open as a
  failed FTP/FTPS transfer. Do not keep extending the same FTP attempt or cycle
  through passive/active/FTPS variants as a substitute for the documented
  fallback.
- When FTP or FTPS connects but uploads fail, stall, or repeatedly time out,
  immediately inspect the project-local config, selected service contract, and
  current user-provided deployment details for an SSH-based SFTP route. If they
  supply the SSH host, port, user, credential reference, and same documented
  remote deploy folder, switch to SFTP over SSH before trying more FTP/FTPS
  upload variants. Treat SFTP over SSH as a valid fulfillment of `gi ftp`.
  Report that SFTP over SSH was used as the fallback.
- If the SFTP route is missing required connection details, stop and report the
  exact missing fields or ask one short question for them. Do not invent SSH
  credentials, private-key paths, or remote paths, and do not keep retrying the
  same failing FTP transfer when an authorized SFTP route is available.
- Do not disable TLS certificate validation, accept an invalid FTPS certificate,
  or treat an invalid-certificate FTPS connection as the routine fallback for a
  failing FTP upload unless the project-local deploy contract or the current
  user message explicitly authorizes that risk. Report any such exception as a
  degraded security path.
- Do not delete or replace remote files unless `cleanRemote` is true and the
  project-local instructions or user request clearly allow that behavior.
- After upload, report the protocol, host, remote path, local artifact path, and
  verification performed. Do not print passwords, tokens, private keys, or full
  credential-bearing command lines.

## Verification

- Confirm the local upload source exists before starting transfer.
- Prefer a dry listing or checksum/size comparison when the tool and server
  support it.
- If verification cannot be performed, say so briefly and report the transfer
  command result without exposing secrets.
