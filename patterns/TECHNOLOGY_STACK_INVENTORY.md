# Technology Stack Inventory

Keep each GI-enabled project technology stack visible in durable project memory.

## Purpose

Agents should not rediscover the same runtimes, frameworks, package managers,
build tools, test tools, external services, and deployment assumptions on every
session. Maintain a concise stack inventory so refactors, dependency changes,
verification plans, and migration work start from a shared source of truth.

## Required File

Use this project-memory file unless local instructions define a more specific
path:

```text
tools/project-memory/specs/technology-stack.md
```

Create it when a project adopts GI or when `gi обновить` introduces this rule.
If the project already has an equivalent stack ADR or architecture note, keep
that note and either link it from `technology-stack.md` or migrate its current
facts into this file without losing decisions.

## What To Record

Record verified current facts, not guesses:

- primary languages and runtimes;
- application frameworks, UI frameworks, API frameworks, and worker runtimes;
- package managers and lockfiles;
- build, test, lint, formatting, packaging, and deployment tools;
- databases, queues, caches, vector stores, object storage, and search engines;
- external APIs, SDKs, service IDs, and contract endpoints;
- local development entry points, ports, and health checks when stable;
- generated artifacts and rebuildable indexes;
- deprecated, legacy, or transitional stack components;
- evidence paths such as manifests, config files, lockfiles, runbooks, and
  project-memory specs;
- open verification gaps when the stack cannot be identified from current
  files.

Do not store secrets, tokens, credentials, or private user data. Reference secret
locations only by documented environment variable or config key name.

## Update Rules

- Update the inventory in the same scoped change that adds, removes, upgrades,
  replaces, or materially reconfigures a runtime, framework, package manager,
  storage engine, external service, build tool, test runner, or deployment
  target.
- Verify stack facts from current files before editing code that depends on
  those facts. Handoff summaries and old chats are status evidence only.
- Keep stack choices separate from product identity. Do not hard-code demo
  names, selected workflow labels, generated product names, or user-specific
  paths as if they were technology requirements.
- When a component is only inferred, mark it as inferred and list the evidence
  or the missing verification step.
- Prefer stable relative paths in evidence. Use absolute paths only when the
  project explicitly records an approved external workspace dependency.

## Verification

For stack inventory changes, run the smallest checks that fit the scope:

- parse edited JSON/YAML/TOML manifests when touched;
- verify `technology-stack.md` exists for GI-enabled projects;
- check that newly recorded commands and stack facts match current manifests or
  runbooks;
- use `git diff --check` or the project equivalent for whitespace issues.
